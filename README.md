# KosTorrentCli

KosTorrentCli - is planned to become a custom torrent console client which is currently under development for educational purposes.
For the first version, my goal is to be able to download a single torrent without seeding. Since how torrent works in detail, knowledge is slowly evaporating from the web, I'm going to create an ultimate guideline document of how it is working once I will finish this project. 
The link to that guideline will be posted here.

All documentation data based on which I'm developing this client is located here:
